# Debug Locally

Debugging a Node.js TypeScript Lambda function locally using VS Code involves several steps. Here's a guide to help you get started:

- Create the `.vscode\launch.json` file with the following content:
    ```json
    {
    "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "launch",
                "name": "Debug Local File",
                "runtimeArgs": [
                    "-r",
                    "ts-node/register"
                ],
                "args": "${relativeFile}",
                "env": {
                    "AWS_PROFILE": "sandbox",
                    "AWS_REGION": "ap-southeast-2"
                },
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    This file is used by VS Code and this configuration will launch a `node` to debug the local file in the active tab. 

    > Note: The environment variables for AWS_REGION and AWS_PROFILE are used to access any AWS resources.

- Create a bootstrap file for local debug, `tests\LocalDebug.ts`:
    ```ts
    // This is a file bootstrap for debugging a Node.js TypeScript Lambda function locally using VS Code.
    // Update file to call the required handler function that you want to debug.

    // Debug hello.ts Lambda function locally
    import { handler } from "../src/services/hello";
    handler ({} as any, {} as any);
    ```
- Set a breakpoint in `hello.ts` and lanuch the debugger with the `LocalDebug.ts` in the active tab.
